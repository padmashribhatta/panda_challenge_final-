Looking at the districtwide test results we investigated the math result, reading result looked at various other information about the schools the students attended.

A brief summary number of schools = 15 number of students = 39170 total budget = 24649428 average_math_score = 78.98 average_reading_score = 81.87 % of students passing_math = 74.98 % of students passing_reading = 85.80 % of students passing_math_reading = 65.17

Analysis and comparison The smaller schools presents stronger result than the larger school Even though the per student budget is higher in disctrict school the result is lesser than charter school becuse in charter school less students in each class maybe students get extra attention from teachers.

According to our % of per_school_passing _math_reading_overall we can say students are good in reading score compare to their math score. our overall passing % is droping because of students match score eventhough they score highest score in reading.
